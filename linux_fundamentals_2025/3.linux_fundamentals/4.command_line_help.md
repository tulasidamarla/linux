## Environment variables
- Environment variables store information. 
- These are name/value pairs and typically names are in uppercase.
- To access a environment variable value use `$` symbol as in `echo $PATH`.

## PATH
- It contains a list of directories seperated by a colon(:).
- This env variable controls command search path.
  - when a command is entered in the prompt, that command will be searched for in the directories that are listed in the path environment variable.
  - In the below example the command `ls` is searched in the `/usr/local/sbin` first. If not found, then searched in `/usr/local/bin`. This process goes on until the last path.
  - If the command is not found in any of the listed directories of path, `command not found` message will appear. 
```
[root@sh-mh ~]# echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin
[root@sh-mh ~]# ls
anaconda-ks.cfg  katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
[root@sh-mh ~]# whatsup
-bash: whatsup: command not found
```

### Locate a command(which)
- To locate a command use `which` command. For ex
```
[root@sh-mh ~]# which cat
/usr/bin/cat
[root@sh-mh ~]# which tac
/usr/bin/tac
[root@sh-mh ~]# which java
/usr/bin/java
[root@sh-mh ~]# which ls
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
	/usr/bin/ls
```
- `tac` command is to print the content in reverse order.

### For help
- Many commands provide help with `--help` flag. For ex: `ls --help`.
- Use `man -k searchterm` for searching a command.
```
[root@sh-mh ~]# man -k calendar
cal (1)              - display a calendar
cal (1p)             - print a calendar
difftime (3p)        - compute the difference between two calendar time values
zshcalsys (1)        - zsh calendar system
```
