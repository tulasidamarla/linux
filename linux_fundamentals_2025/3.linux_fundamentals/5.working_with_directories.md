## Directories
- These are containers for other files and directories
- Directories provide a tree like structure.
- These can be accessed by name or shortcut.
  - Shortcuts
    - `.` Current directory
    - `..` Parent directory
    - `cd -` Change to previous directory
- `pwd` gives present working directory location
- `OLDPWD` environment variable gives the working directory of the previous.

```
[root@symphony-dev-cluster1 opt]# pwd
/opt
[root@symphony-dev-cluster1 opt]# cd /root
[root@symphony-dev-cluster1 ~]# echo $OLDPWD
/opt
```

### Creating and removing directories
- To create a directory use the command `mkdir [-p] /path/of/the/directory`
  - `-p` is for creating all parent directories if don't exist.
- Please see the below example.
```
[root@symphony-dev-cluster1 ~]# mkdir /opt/test1/test2
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/opt/test1/test2’: No such file or directory
[root@symphony-dev-cluster1 ~]# mkdir -p /opt/test1/test2
```
- To remove a directory use command `rmdir [-p] /path/of/the/directory`.
- Use the above command with `-p` only when all parent directories are empty.
- To remove a directory and its subdirectories and files recursively use `rm -rf /path/to/the/directory`.

## Note: When removing directories in linux, there is no recycle bin. So use the command carefully.
