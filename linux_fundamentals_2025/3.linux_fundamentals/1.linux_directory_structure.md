## Linux directory structure
- Having knowledge on linux directory structure helps navigating the file system quickly and saves time.

### Important top level directories

- `/` `Root`, the top of the file system hierarchy
- `/bin`, Binaries and other executable programs. 
  - The programs are written in source code and are human readable text files. These files are then compiled to machine readable binaries.
- `/boot` contains all the files needed to boot the system before the main OS loads.
- `/cgroup` contains control groups hierarchy.
  - cgroup is a kernel feature that controls how much CPU, memory, I/O, etc. a process or group of processes can use.
  - It helps in sharing RAM for all processes.
  - Using cgroups we can
    - limit CPU
    - limit memory
    - throttle disk I/O
    - freeze processes
    - track resource usage
  - Older distros used `/cgroup` whereas modern distros use `/sys/fs/cgroup`.
isolate workloads  
- `/etc` contains configuration files. 
  - Configuration files control how the OS or applications behave.
    - For ex, there is a configuration file in `/etc`, that tells OS whether to boot in text mode or graphical mode.
- `/home` contains all users home directories.
  - For ex, `/home/tulasi`, `/home/clusteradmin` etc.
- `/opt` contains optional or third party software.
  - `/opt` is for software that is not bundled with the operating system. For ex, `Google earth`.
- `/tmp` is temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
- `/usr` contains user related programs.
- `/var` contains variable data. 
  - For ex, things that change very often like log files that generated by OS or applications etc.

#### Difference between /bin and /usr/bin

- `/bin` → essential commands needed for booting and repairing the system
  - Very small set of core tools.
  - Must be available even if other filesystems aren’t mounted yet.
  - So critical commands must be in /bin like `/bin/sh`, `/bin/ls`, `/bin/mount`, `/bin/cp`, `/bin/mkdir`.
- `/usr/bin` → all the normal user-level programs
  - Tons of applications live here.
  - Not required for the system to boot.
  - /usr might live on a separate partition or disk.
  - stuff that isn't needed for booting goes under /usr/bin like `/usr/bin/gcc`, `/usr/bin/vim`, `/usr/bin/curl`, `/usr/bin/python`, `/usr/bin/git` etc.

### Other top level directories

#### /dev
- `/dev` exposes devices as files.
  - It's like a “control panel” where every hardware device, pseudo-device, and kernel interface shows up as a special file.
  - these device nodes that let user programs talk directly to hardware or kernel features as if they were files.
  - /dev entries are created by udev dynamically. For ex, when USB plugged in, /dev/sdb appears and when removed it disappears.
  - In Unix philosophy, everything is a file, that's why it kept everything as a file.
  - Types of devices in `/dev`
    - Block devices -> storage devices that read/write in blocks
      - `/dev/sda`      # First HDD/SSD
      - `/dev/nvme0n1`  # NVMe drive
      - `/dev/loop0`    # Loopback device
    - Character Devices (c) -> Devices that read/write one character at a time.
      - `/dev/random`    # Random number generator
      - `/dev/tty`       # Terminal devices
      - `/dev/console`   # System console
      - `/dev/null`      # The black hole :)
    - Pseudo-devices -> Not real hardware, but behave like devices.
      - `/dev/null`       # Discard everything
      - `/dev/zero`       # Infinite zeros
      - `/dev/urandom`    # Faster random generator
  - Examples
    - Send text to terminal `echo "hello" > /dev/tty`.
    - Erase a file by overwriting with zeros `dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1M count=1`.
    - Generate random bytes `head -c 20 /dev/urandom`.
    - Blackhole output `command > /dev/null 2>&1`.

#### /lib
- These directories store shared libraries that the system and essential programs need to run.
- They are like `C:\Windows\System32` on windows and `/usr/lib` on mac.
- /lib contained 32-bit libraries on systems that supported both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
- On pure 64-bit systems, /lib may just be a symlink to /usr/lib
- Examples 
  - `/lib/libc.so.6`
  - `/lib/modules/5.14.0/`
  - `/lib/ld-linux.so.2`

#### /lib64
- This directory exists so the system knows where to find 64-bit versions of essential libraries when both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries exist.
- Examples
  - `/lib64/libc.so.6`
  - `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`
- Modern distros like RHEL/FEDORA/Centos/Rocky uses symlinks as below to handle this.
  - `/lib`   -> symlink to /usr/lib
  - `/lib64` -> symlink to /usr/lib64
