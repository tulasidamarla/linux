## Operating system(OS)
- An operating system is a collection of softwares that manages hardware resources and provides an environment where applications run.
- The OS allows applications to store information, send documents to a printer and interact with users.
  - A Linux distribution is simply a collection of software and applications bundled together and distributed as a single operating system.
  - One Linux distribution might come with one particular web browser installed, while another Linux distribution will come with a different 
    web browser installed by default.
- Linux kernal is the core of the OS. It's the layer that sits between the hardware and applications.
- For an OS to be useful, we need other components in addition to the kernal like system libraries, graphical user interfaces, email utilities, web browsers.
- The two most popular Linux distributions used in information technology departments and by linux professionals are Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL) and Ubuntu.

### RHEL 
- RHEL is a licensed software. So, we need to pay for a license to run Red Hat.But, recently it made changes to it's license agreement. So, it allows to run up
  to 16 systems without having to pay for a license.
- To avoid managing and paying for licenses, We can use a Red Hat enterprise Linux derivative that's completely free.
- The two most popular free Red Hat enterprise Linux derivatives are Alma Linux and Rocky Linux.
  - These are really Red Hat with a branding and logos replaced with either alma logos or rocky logos.
  - Either one is perfect if we're going to be run Linux for personal projects at home or want a Linux distro to practice on.
- CentOS Linux used to fill the role of a free Red Hat Enterprise Linux clone.
  - However, it recently moved from being a clone of Red Hat to being more of a preview of what is coming to Red Hat.

### Ubuntu
- If we want to work for a startup or smaller, more nimble web based companies like software as a service type businesses, social networking sites, smaller 
  ecommerce stores, or companies that rely heavily on cloud computing, then ubuntu is the right choice of distribution.

### Other distributions
- If you're using Linux strictly for fun, for personal projects or just want to see what other distributions have to offer try out some other popular distros 
  such as `Linux mint`, `Manjaro`, `POP!_OS`, `Fedora`, `Debian`, `Open Suse`,  `Arch Linux`  and `Slackware`.

### Package managers
- Linux distros mostly fall into a few big families. Each family has its own package format and package manager.

  - Package managers:
    - APT (Advanced Package Tool) — apt, apt-get, apt-cache

- `Red Hat / Fedora / CentOS / Rocky / Alma Family`
  - Package format: .rpm
  - Package managers:
    - DNF (modern, Fedora/RHEL 8+)
    - YUM (older, still exists in RHEL 7/CentOS 7)
    - RPM (low-level installer)
  - Distros using it: RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Oracle Linux.
- `SUSE / openSUSE Family`
  - Package format: .rpm
